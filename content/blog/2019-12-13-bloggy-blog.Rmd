##Here are some neat things that we've been doing in python!! 

```{r}
###First I'm gonna load reticulate 
library(reticulate)

```

##Here's some basic function coding in python- let's say you start with a list of numbers or letters and way to do a simple loop printing them, you could do something like this! 

```{python}
for letter in "pythoniscool":
    print(letter)
```

```{python}
primes=[2,3,5,7,11]
for i in primes:
    print(i)
```
##You can also use "for" commands like this: 
```{python}
for i in range (1,30,3):
    print(i)###I just told python to start at 1 and count up to 30 by intervals of 3
```


##You can count occurances in a string like this: 
```{python}

import numpy as np

import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
def count_chars(sentence): 
    counts = {} #make an empty dictionary
    for c in sentence: #for every value in the sentence 
        if c in counts:
            counts[c]+=1 #if its a value that's already shown up add +1 to counts
        else:
            counts[c]=1 #If it's a new value, hold counts for values steady
    for c in counts:
        print(c, "appears", counts[c],"times")##Telling what to put in between characters, for example 'c appears 2 times' etc. 


##Let's try it out!! 
sentence1= "I can learn to code" 
count_chars(sentence1)
```
##Ok so we can see how often a single character appears in a group, but we can also see how many times GROUPS of characters appear with a (similar but modified) function. Let's look at nucleotide sequences as an example 

```{python}
def kmers(read, k):  ##defining a function for some sequecnce you're reading 'read' by groups 'k'. For our example k=3 
    counts = {}  ##Another empty dictionary 
    num_kmers = len(read) - k + 1###sets the numbers to read length of the seuqnce -one more than the selected length of our read 
    for i in range(num_kmers):
        kmer = read[i:i+k]##reading from 1 through however many we picked (so for example, 1-4 gets you a read of 3)
        if kmer not in counts:##This count function is pretty much exactly the same!
            counts[kmer] = 0
        counts[kmer] += 1
    return counts
##Let's try it!

my_seq1= "ATCATGATCATGATCATC" 

kmers(my_seq1,3)

##If we wanted to count by 4, we could just do this 

kmers(my_seq1,4) 
```

##Some basic regex 

```{python}
import re

string="I can learn to code" 
match=re.match(r"I.*learn",string)
match.group()
```
