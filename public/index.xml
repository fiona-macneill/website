      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&#39;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&#39;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&#39;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&#39;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>(5 pts) Introduce your dataset and each of your variables (or just your main variables if you have lots) in a paragraph.
I chose to work with the “meuse” dataset for project 2, because I’m becoming really interested in spatial variables and what happens if some response variables/factors change along an environmental gradient and others don’t. The “meuse” dataset provides information about various metal concentrations along the Meuse river. This is a dataset I’ve used before to practice making spatial plots, and I thought it would be really neat to try and run analysis on different variables as well.</description>

      <description>Steps 1 and 2: Joining and reshaping data
##I decided to download two datasets from Austin.gov public access data. One shows emercency responses in Austin and in the rest of Travis county, the other shows average costs of utility bills and energy usage in kWh. They share observation dates, which I will join them by (one date for month-year). I noticed as I started the project that for the emergency dataset, Austin sometimes has more emergency responses listed than Travis county, so I beleieve that it’s recording emergencies in Austin, and emergencies in the rest of Travis county (not Austin), but it’s not totally clear to me from the dataset description.</description>
