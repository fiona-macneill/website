      <description>(5 pts) Introduce your dataset and each of your variables (or just your main variables if you have lots) in a paragraph.
I chose to work with the “meuse” dataset for project 2, because I’m becoming really interested in spatial variables and what happens if some response variables/factors change along an environmental gradient and others don’t. The “meuse” dataset provides information about various metal concentrations along the Meuse river. This is a dataset I’ve used before to practice making spatial plots, and I thought it would be really neat to try and run analysis on different variables as well.</description>

      <description>Steps 1 and 2: Joining and reshaping data
##I decided to download two datasets from Austin.gov public access data. One shows emercency responses in Austin and in the rest of Travis county, the other shows average costs of utility bills and energy usage in kWh. They share observation dates, which I will join them by (one date for month-year). I noticed as I started the project that for the emergency dataset, Austin sometimes has more emergency responses listed than Travis county, so I beleieve that it’s recording emergencies in Austin, and emergencies in the rest of Travis county (not Austin), but it’s not totally clear to me from the dataset description.</description>
